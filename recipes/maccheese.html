            <p class="description">
                Some slow cookers take less time. Check the edges are not getting too brown after 2 1/2 hours.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                To bake in a conventional oven, pour pasta mixture into a casserole dish and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
