                    <p>
                        Some slow cookers take less time. Check the edges are not getting too brown after 2 1/2 hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To bake in a conventional oven, pour pasta mixture into a casserole dish and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
