            <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

            <li>1 cup broccoli florets</li>
            <li>1 small zucchini, sliced in half vertically, then sliced crosswise</li>
            <li>1 cup matchstick-cut carrots</li>
            <li>8 spears fresh asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3 ounces finely-grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>fresh flat-leaf parsley sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>How to prepare:</h3>
        <ol title="Instructions List">
            <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels and season with Italian seasoning. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in a large, non-stick skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>When oil is hot and butter is bubbling, add chicken thighs and cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn chicken, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until juices no longer run pink, about 5 minutes more.  An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the skillet, place on a serving platter, and keep warm.</li>
            <li>To the same pan, over medium high heat, add remaining olive oil and butter, and allow butter to melt. Stir in onions and red pepper flakes and cook 1 to 2 minutes, then add mushrooms and bell peppers. Cook an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Add broccoli florets, zucchini, and carrots. Cook, stirring, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add asparagus, tomatoes, and garlic; cook until garlic is fragrant, about a minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in chicken broth and allow to come to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and stir in peas. When broth is lightly bubbling, add cream slowly, stirring, and stir in Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>To serve place 2 chicken thighs on each plate and top with vegetables and Parmesan cream. Garnish with fresh flat-leaf parsley. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Chef's Notes</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of the recipe is to keep the vegetables colorful and crisp-tender. If you prefer softer vegetables, cook them in the chicken broth until they reach your preferred texture, and then add the peas, cream, and Parmesan.
